# Book-A-Resort
                                               Book A Resort

My project is a resort booking system that incorporates various features and functionalities. It follows an object-oriented programming approach and utilizes concepts such as classes, graphs, recursion, searching, sorting stl, and basic concepts like array, string, loops, and conditional statements.

The project starts by collecting registration details from the users, including their name, age, gender, email, and phone number. Information about the number of people, their names, ages, and genders is also recorded. This information is stored in a map or a class for efficient retrieval and management.

Once the registration details are obtained and stored, the system displays the available room types and their respective costs. This includes options such as single-bed non-AC room, single-bed AC room, double-bed non-AC room, and double-bed AC room. The system then calculates the total cost based on the selected room type and the required number. All the information gathered so far is printed for confirmation.

Next, the system presents a list of available enjoyment features and their associated costs. Users are prompted to select their desired activities, and the system calculates the total cost based on their choices. To determine the minimum distance between activity spots, I have implemented the Dijkstra algorithm, which aids in suggesting the most optimal route for visitors.

The project further allows users to choose breakfast items from a menu, displaying the corresponding costs for each item. The system calculates the total cost based on the selected items, and the accumulated cost is added to the overall total cost. At this stage, the system prints all the information collected throughout the process.

Finally, the system prompts users to provide feedback and reviews about the services offered. This serves as a platform for users to express their thoughts and experiences regarding the resort and its amenities.

Overall, this project demonstrates the implementation of a resort booking system that efficiently handles user registration, room selection, activity planning, meal customization, and feedback gathering.
